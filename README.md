# SimpleTax
Rudimentary software for the calculation, approval, and payment of a tax bill. Project for COMP-3700 - Software Modeling & Design at Auburn University.
Created by: Ethan Brown, Sonny Cho, Colin Clifton, Kendall Goode, Joohna Kim, & Gu Zheng

  The idea behind this project is to allow a user to generate a summary of their tax bill given certain information, have that summary approved by an admin, 
and allow the admin to schedule an appointment with the user.

  We decided to cover these use cases by implementing a user account creation and login tool, tools for scanning in tax information from documents, tools for
administator management of user accounts, and a two-way messaging system between users and administrators.
